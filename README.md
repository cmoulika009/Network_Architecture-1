# Network Architecture-1

This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts and principles in the design and implementation of computer communication networks, their protocols, and architectures. Topics to be covered include: layering, and addressing, naming, routing, internetworking, Internet protocols, reliable transfer, congestion control, link control, multiple media access, and network measurement and management.

As part of this course we have developed Client and Server programs to send messages based on verious scenarios and also file transfer between Client & Server using GENI.
